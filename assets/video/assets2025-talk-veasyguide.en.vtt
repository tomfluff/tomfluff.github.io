00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.280
Hello.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.720
Very excited to be here.

4
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.680
And, my name is Yotam
from the University of Tokyo.

5
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.680
And on behalf of my coauthors,

6
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.840
I'm happy to present VeasyGuide.

7
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.200
So online learning is very common

8
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.200
these days, especially with videos,

9
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
in platforms like YouTube, Khan Academy, Coursera,

10
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.400
or even recorded lectures from zoom.

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.800
And many of these videos also contain slides.

12
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.360
And for learning, communication

13
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.360
between instructors
and students is very important.

14
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160
And, how do instructors

15
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.160
communicate with student and slide based videos?

16
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.040
So, a lot of instructors
use, for example, pointers

17
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.520
or digital pens to communicate

18
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.520
their intent to the students.

19
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.320
For instance, instructors

20
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.640
can use pointing actions to point

21
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.640
to different parts of the slide,

22
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.240
to convey their intent or they can use

23
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.240
marking actions
to emphasize certain portions of the slides.

24
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.880
Moreover, they can use sketching to,

25
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.920
add additional content

26
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.320
to the slide
and explain different concepts to students.

27
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
So using these three methods: pointing,

28
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.720
marking, and sketching, instructors can communicate
with the students.

29
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.720
Let's see an example of that from Khan Academy.

30
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.080
Try to pay attention to the pointing,
marking and sketching actions.

31
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080
And this video has sound.

32
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.520
This video has sound.

33
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.000
Yeah, this video should have sound.

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.320
This video has sound.

35
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.240
All of our elements are listed here
in the periodic table of elements.

36
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.160
C stands for carbon.

37
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.160
I'm just going through
the ones that are very relevant to humanity.

38
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.000
But over time, you'll
probably familiarize yourself with all of these.

39
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480
This is oxygen. This is nitrogen.

40
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.200
This is silicon.

41
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.600
This is a U is gold.

42
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.800
This is lead.

43
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.800
As you can see,

44
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.200
trying to follow along is kind of challenging.

45
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.280
And it's can be very difficult,
especially for low vision

46
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.720
learners who still use the residual vision.

47
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.240
So for low vision learners, this kind of like

48
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.880
problem is called the visual search problem,
which is basically not knowing

49
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.560
where to look and what to look for.

50
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.880
And this leads to a lot of

51
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.920
like frustration, exhaustion

52
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920
and very high cognitive effort,

53
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.040
which makes learning a bit much more difficult.

54
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.120
So a lot of people just give up on the visuals
and only listen,

55
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.200
but they give up on a lot of visual information

56
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.200
that can be very important.

57
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.800
So this poses our main

58
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.240
research question,
which is what can we do to improve this experience

59
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.240
for low vision individuals?

60
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.760
And to address this we introduce VeasyGuide.

61
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.560
So VeasyGuide basically detects activities
such as that

62
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.800
highlights them and makes it simple to zoom

63
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.160
with personalization incorporated.

64
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.280
Now I'm going to show the same video as before,

65
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.280
but with the VeasyGuide enabled.

66
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.400
The users can click to zoom,
or they can pause the video

67
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520
to personalize the highlights.

68
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.720
All of our elements are listed here
in the periodic table of elements.

69
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.640
C stands for carbon.

70
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.040
I'm just going through
the ones that are very relevant

71
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.400
to humanity,
but over time you'll probably familiarize

72
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720
and the user can personalize as well.

73
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.840
As yourself with all of these.

74
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.080
This is oxygen. This is nitrogen.

75
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.320
This is silica.

76
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.000
Or it change the personalization

77
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.360
throughout the video on this is AEW is gold.

78
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.520
This is led.

79
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.960
So using these

80
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.440
so VeasyGuide was created
with an co-design process.

81
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.360
It was a co-design with three low vision
participants

82
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.680
as well as my own experience
as a as a low vision individual.

83
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.720
And we had three main questions
for the co-design process.

84
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.280
The first is how do low vision experience
visual activities?

85
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.240
What challenges these activities introduce,

86
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.960
and also what makes these activities easier
to detect?

87
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.200
For the sake of time,
I'm going to focus on the third question.

88
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.520
So through the co-design process
and the iteration,

89
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.560
we created those, design implications
for VeasyGuide.

90
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.560
And once the VeasyGuide is based on,

91
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.440
the first one is, of course,
providing visual access.

92
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.680
With less effort.

93
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.720
And we do that through highlights
and magnification or zoom.

94
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.320
The second one is that visual styles
should be familiar

95
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.600
to users and familiarity,
something that we achieve through

96
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.800
consistent styles throughout the video,

97
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.320
and also using familiar indicators.

98
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.320
So, for instance, in guide

99
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.520
we use mouse pointers of different shapes.

100
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.920
One more

101
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.920
thing is predictability of what,

102
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.120
when and where to look.

103
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.160
So in this guide we introduce

104
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.040
a 1.5 seconds pre activity highlight.

105
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.440
So the highlight shows before an activity starts.

106
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.320
And also we implement a box shape highlight

107
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.600
which C1 mentioned.

108
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.840
The box tells me exactly where and on
what to look at.

109
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.480
So the box gives spatial information as well.

110
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.040
And finally personalization
for different visual abilities.

111
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.200
So different people have different needs.

112
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.480
And so having personalization
as part of the design itself

113
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.640
allows this guide to be, usable
by many more people.

114
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.120
So these are the four design implications

115
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.120
that are the source of easy guide.

116
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.560
Visio itself is, composed of two main components

117
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.240
an activity recognition pipeline,
which uses computer vision methods,

118
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.280
as well as a graph representation

119
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.480
of the visual changes

120
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.480
that allows us to detect activities

121
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.320
and activity visualization,
which is implemented as a web based application

122
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.520
so activities can be changed
and customized on the fly.

123
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.840
And this

124
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.160
is the base of basically
this is how visit guide works.

125
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.280
So get back to our research question,

126
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.480
of how we improve it.

127
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.360
So the question is will VeasyGuide
improve the experience

128
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.360
of low vision people?

129
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.640
So to evaluate VeasyGuide, we used real world

130
00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.720
videos from various creators with various styles.

131
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.360
And we had, recruited eight low
vision participants

132
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.520
to basically try and see if it can

133
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.920
improve low vision access to visual activities.

134
00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.560
But more than that,
we also recruited eight sighted participants

135
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.160
to see what will be the impact on a visit

136
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.160
guide on sighted people.

137
00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.880
And we had two main tasks.

138
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.960
The first is a localization task,

139
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.040
which allows us to focus on the visual search

140
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.600
problem specifically,
and the second task is a viewing task

141
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.320
which allows us to explore
the experience of learning with easy guide.

142
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.280
So, in this work we prioritize external validity.

143
00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.840
So we allow participants
to use any of their assistive tools,

144
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.280
such as magnifier, screen readers, etc.

145
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.160
and here are some of the results.

146
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.280
So, the first thing is that VeasyGuide
significantly

147
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.760
allows low vision people to notice
more activities.

148
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.680
So from a 16.9% accuracy,

149
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.280
we go up to 88.2%.

150
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.200
So this is a significant improvement.

151
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.840
And they do that with faster times.

152
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.240
So we have a median of 1.37 seconds
using the baseline.

153
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.600
So no VeasyGuide compared to 1.19

154
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.080
seconds with VeasyGuide.

155
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.240
So we can make it faster as well.

156
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.400
But more than that, VeasyGuide
also significantly reduced

157
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.480
the cognitive load that is needed for learning.

158
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.040
So when all of the cognitive load metrics
that we tested

159
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.080
effort, frustration, mental demand,
physical demand

160
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.920
and temporal demand.
VeasyGuide reduced significantly

161
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.760
the difficulty there and,

162
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.960
more than that, qualitative findings

163
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.120
support our results.

164
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.680
So VeasyGuide makes it easier to follow along.

165
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.400
The instructor L2 mentioned,

166
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.880
I felt as if the instructor had control
so I can connect with the instructor.

167
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.480
His intent

168
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.480
and L3

169
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.000
mentioned it helped me stay with the instructor.

170
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.080
I saw that the instructor was drawing a boat

171
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.080
and I was happy I did not miss it.

172
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.280
VeasyGuide also improved the overall experience

173
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.480
of learning L1 mentioned.

174
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.040
One of the biggest problems is that I don't know

175
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.120
what in the video requires my attention.

176
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.520
VeasyGuide offloads this difficulty

177
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.520
to software and eyestrain less

178
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.160
L5 mentioned.

179
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.760
I felt relaxed listening

180
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.920
instead of constantly worrying about where

181
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.240
the next thing that would show up,
I could just sit back,

182
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.560
listen and learn
and remember why I enjoy learning.

183
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.120
But of course, VeasyGuide contains
some limitations as well.

184
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.160
First of all, the learning curve.

185
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.960
So, VC has some learning curves to it.

186
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.600
L1 mentioned I would have to get used to it.

187
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.880
But getting used to it and figuring out

188
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.320
figuring out my own workflow would let me,
I think,

189
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.560
worry less about the visual part
and focus more on the content.

190
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.640
And, some users wanted more granular control.

191
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.840
So beyond the personalization,
some users wanted more control.

192
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.920
So L6 mentioned, with a zoom part of the screen
get cut off.

193
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.760
So I might have missed things.

194
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.760
I'm not sure
if there was a way to move the zoom window,

195
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.480
but I'd really like the freedom to move it around.

196
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.360
So beyond what we did with personalization,

197
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.680
some participants wanted extra controls as well.

198
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.520
For sighted participants,

199
00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.040
we found that VeasyGuide provides
some benefits as well.

200
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.560
For example,
it helps retain and preserve attention.

201
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.240
So S1 mentioned,

202
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.200
if I'm bored, the highlights
help draw my attention

203
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.360
back to the video and to the right place.

204
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.440
It also helps focusing on the learning

205
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.080
with S2 mentioning
I could just focus on receiving information.

206
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.280
It allowed me to focus on the learning part.

207
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.520
So, beyond, low vision people,

208
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.840
it also has the potential to enhance
the learning experience for others as well.

209
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.440
To conclude, we

210
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.800
discussed in the paper on
how can we design tools to support

211
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.920
low vision users in tasks
that require visual search.

212
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.480
So we reflect on our findings from the co-design
process as well as the user study.

213
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.480
And we found, four,

214
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.640
key concepts as a design framework.

215
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.720
The first one is familiarity with target visuals.

216
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.080
The second is predictability

217
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.080
via spatial temporal context

218
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.760
and personalization for changing needs.

219
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.440
So all of these are extended
beyond the co-design findings.

220
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.720
And we introduce another one,

221
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.200
which is preserving the user agency,

222
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.640
which I want to explain in a little bit
more detail.

223
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.320
So VeasyGuide basically gives low vision learners

224
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.280
the choice to look, see or follow the instructor.

225
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.920
And we VeasyGuide, they have the freedom

226
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.240
to always find the right place of focus
so they can look anywhere else

227
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.160
in the slide and decide, actually I want to see
what the instructor is talking about now.

228
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.240
So it gave them the option similar
to some people, to basically see

229
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.160
whatever they want to see at a time
and not miss out on, things.

230
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.040
Thank you so much for listening.

231
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.440
I'm very excited to share this, work.

232
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.720
VeasyGuide is available online right now

233
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.120
with a few sample videos, but very soon

234
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.840
you will be able to use your own videos
and have VeasyGuide work on them.

235
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.960
So please stay tuned for that.

236
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.200
And thank you so much.
