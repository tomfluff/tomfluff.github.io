I had the privilege of presenting our work _"VeasyGuide: Personalized Visual Guidance for Low-vision Learners on Instructor Actions in Presentation Videos"_ at **ASSETS 2025 (International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility)**. This presentation marked an important milestone in my research on making learning accessible for low-vision learners.

> This was my first time presenting at ASSETS, and it was an incredible experience to share our findings with a community so dedicated to accessibility.

The presentation and interaction with the listeners was very impactful for me. I got so many wonderful questions during and after the talk! I truly appreciate everyone who watched, asked questions, and provided feedback on this work. Below I put the video recording of the talk and the transcriptions of the Q&A session. There are so many more things to do to improve online learning accessibility for low-vision learners!
