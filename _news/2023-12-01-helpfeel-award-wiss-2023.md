title: 'Awarded the Helpfeel award for <i>"Smart Replay"</i> (WISS 2023) 🎉'
---

On a backdrop of the end of 2023, surrounded by snowy mountain ranges, I had the opportunity to present our work _"Smart Replay: eラーニング動画における視覚的・時間的アクセシビリティの向上"_ at **WISS 2023 (Workshop on Interactive Systems and Software)**. This was my very first oral presentation of a paper at a conference—a memorable milestone in my research journey.

To our delight, our project on e-learning accessibility received the **Helpfeel Award**, recognizing both the technical contribution and the broader vision of making video learning more inclusive for people with disabilities.

The reviewers and award committee emphasized how the work not only tackled practical issues learners face when using video platforms, but also reflected a broader commitment to accessibility and user experience. Their comments encouraged us to keep pushing toward real-world deployment and impact. Read more on this [Helpfeel blog post](https://blog.notainc.com/entry/2023/12/11/165959).

WISS itself is a wonderful conference—a local but vibrant gathering of the HCI community in Japan. It was held this year in **Kobuchizawa** at the Royal Hotel 八ヶ岳, surrounded by mountains and stunning scenery. The atmosphere was inspiring, both academically and personally.

You can catch a glimpse of the area in [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RsLz1O_5lM):

Overall, it was a deeply rewarding experience—presenting in Japan, connecting with the local HCI community, and seeing our work recognized with an award. It gives me a lot of motivation for the next steps in this project. 💪
