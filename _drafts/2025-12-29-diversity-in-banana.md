title: "Banana Diversity: Can Nano-Banana Create my Picture?"

description: "I have albinism. Can Gemini with nano-banana generate my image? I went on a small exploration journey to see if Gemini can understand how I look like from a few examples and correctly generatte my picutre. What did I find? Currently, nano-banana is still biassed towards the data, and cannot really replicate the unique way of how I look."

In this jolly holiday season, where we can sit in-front of the fireplace, and enjoy a nice cup of tea (or coffee in my case), not everyone have access to a fireplace---for example, me. While I don't have access to a fireplace, it can still be nice to experience this festive sensation! So when I logged into Gemini recently and was prompted with a very appealing question: \_"Hey, do you want me to generate a picture of you in-front of the fireplace for the holidays? 🙂" I was, obviously, very intrigued. Then I wondered, can the nano-banana model and Gemini actually understand how I look and generate my picture based on a few examples?

Why is this interesting you may ask? Well, I have albinism, and as a person with albinism, I look very different from what you would assume an average person looks like. Since these giant AI models are trained on big amounts of data, they are very good in generalization. But I am very far from _"the general"_. So, of course, I was very skeptic. **Is nano-banana diverse enough to represent people with albinism?**
