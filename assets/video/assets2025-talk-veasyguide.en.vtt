00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:04.400
[YOTAM] Hello. Hello, everyone. 
Very excited to be here.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.320
And, my name is Yotam
from the University of Tokyo.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.040
And on behalf of my coauthors,
I'm happy to present VeasyGuide.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.207
So, online learning is very common
these days, especially with videos,

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:20.560
in platforms like YouTube,
Khan Academy, Coursera,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.330
or even recorded
lectures from Zoom.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.002
And many of these videos
also contain slides.

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:31.160
And for learning, communication
between instructors

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
and students is very important.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.855
And, how do instructors communicate
with student in slide based videos?

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.055
So, a lot of instructors
use, for example, pointers

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.760
or digital pens to communicate
their intent to the students.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.520
For instance, instructors
can use pointing actions

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.942
to point to different parts of
the slide, to convey their intent.

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:57.095
Or they can use

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.920
marking actions to emphasize
certain portions of the slides.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.575
Moreover, they can use sketching to,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.975
add additional content to the slide and
explain different concepts to students.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.193
So using these three methods
pointing, marking, and sketching,

00:01:14.218 --> 00:01:16.593
instructors can communicate
with the students.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.440
Let's see an example of that
from Khan Academy.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.760
Try to pay attention to the pointing,
marking, and sketching actions.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.085
And this video has sound.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.895
[VIDEO] All of our elements are listed here
in the periodic table of elements.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.452
C stands for carbon.

00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:34.560
I'm just going through the ones
that are very relevant to humanity.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
But over time you'll probably familiarize
yourself with all of these.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.640
This is oxygen.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.520
This is nitrogen, this is silicon.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.160
This is, Au is gold.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.960
This is lead...

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.200
[YOTAM] As you can see, trying to follow
along is kind of challenging.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.600
And it's can be very difficult,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.720
especially for low vision learners
who still use the residual vision.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.760
So for low vision learning
this kind of like problem

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.880
is called the visual search problem, which
is basically not knowing where to look.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.840
And what to look for.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.933
And this leads to a lot of
like frustration, exhaustion

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:14.040
and very high cognitive effort, which
makes learning much more difficult.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.120
So a lot of people just give up
on the visuals and only listen,

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.480
but they give up on a lot of visual
information that can be very important.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.080
So this poses our main
research question, which is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.800
what can we do to improve this
experience for low vision individuals?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.160
And to address this
we introduce VeasyGuide.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.935
So VeasyGuide basically detects activities
such as that, highlights them,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.160
and makes it simple to zoom
with personalization incorporated.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.880
Now I'm going to show the same video as
before, but with VeasyGuide enabled.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.880
The users can click to zoom,

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.579
or they can pause the video
to personalize the highlights.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.175
[VIDEO] All of our elements are listed here
in the periodic table of elements.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800
C stands for carbon.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.840
I'm just going through the ones
that are very relevant to humanity,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.780
but over time you'll
probably familiarize...

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.930
[YOTAM] And the user
can personalize as well.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.040
[VIDEO] ...yourself with all of these.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.480
This is oxygen. This is nitrogen.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.862
This is silicon...

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.220
[YOTAM] Or change the personalization.

00:03:16.615 --> 00:03:19.428
[VIDEO] ...this is Au is gold.

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:20.835
This is led.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.640
[YOTAM] So VeasyGuide was
created in a co-design process.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.611
It was a co-design with
three low vision participants,

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:31.840
as well as my own experience
as a low vision individual.

00:03:32.213 --> 00:03:35.290
And we had three main questions
for the co-design process.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.480
The first is how do low vision
experience visual activities?

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.720
What challenges these
activities introduce,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.120
and also what makes these
activities easier to detect?

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.880
For the sake of time, I'm going
to focus on the third question.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.720
So through the co-design
process and the iteration,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.720
we created those, design
implications for VeasyGuide.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.960
And ones the
VeasyGuide is based on,

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.840
the first one is of course providing
visual access, with less effort.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.920
And we do that through highlights
and magnification or zoom.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.160
The second one is that visual
styles should be familiar to users.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.800
And familiarity is something
that we achieve through

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.520
consistent styles throughout the video,
and also using familiar indicators.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.680
So for instance, in VeasyGuide we
use mouse pointers of different shapes.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.280
One more thing is predictability
of what, when and where to look.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.240
So in VeasyGuide we introduce a
1.5 seconds pre-activity highlight.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.800
So the highlight shows
before an activity starts.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.573
And also we implement a box
shape highlight, which C1 mentioned:

00:04:39.598 --> 00:04:43.040
"The box tells me exactly
where and on what to look at."

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.040
So the box gives spatial
information as well.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.240
And finally personalization
for different visual abilities.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.400
So different people have different needs.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.968
And so having personalization
as part of the design itself,

00:04:55.993 --> 00:05:00.000
allows VeasyGuide to be,
usable by many more people.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.071
So these are the four design implications
that are the source of VeasyGuide.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:08.935
VeasyGuide itself is composed
of two main components

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.575
and activity recognition pipeline,
which uses computer vision methods.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.680
As well as a graph representation
of the visual changes,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.735
that allows us to detect activities.

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.400
And activity visualization,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.520
which is implemented as
a web based application,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.720
so activities can be changed
and customized on the fly.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.040
And this is the base of VeasyGuide.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.498
This is how VeasyGuide works.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.680
So getting back to our research
question, of how we improve it.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.520
So the question is will VeasyGuide improve
the experience of low vision people?

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.428
So to evaluate VeasyGuide,
we used real world videos.

00:05:45.453 --> 00:05:47.920
From various creators, with various styles.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.280
And we had, recruited eight low
vision participants to basically

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.120
try and see if it can improve low
vision access to visual activities.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.280
But more than that, we also recruited
eight sighted participants to see

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.560
what will be the impact of
VeasyGuide on sighted people.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.080
And we had two main tasks.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.125
The first is a localization task,

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.828
which allows us to focus on the visual
search problem specifically.

00:06:12.852 --> 00:06:14.760
And the second task is a viewing task,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.520
which allows us to explore the
experience of learning with VeasyGuide.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.480
So, in this work we prioritize
external validity.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.040
So we allow participants to
use any of their assistive tools,

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.240
such as magnifier, screen readers, etc.

00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:32.413
And here are some of the results.

00:06:32.438 --> 00:06:34.440
So, the first thing is that VeasyGuide

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.106
significantly allows low vision
people to notice more activities.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:44.360
So from a 60.9% accuracy,
we go up to 88.2%.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.280
So this is a significant improvement.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.960
And they do that with faster times.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.528
So we have a median of 1.37 seconds
using the baseline, so no VeasyGuide.

00:06:54.553 --> 00:06:59.160
Compared to 1.19 seconds
with VeasyGuide.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.680
So we can make it faster as well.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.440
But more than that, VeasyGuide
also significantly reduced

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.785
the cognitive load that
is needed for learning.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.455
So when all of the cognitive load metrics
that we tested effort, frustration,

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.189
mental demand, physical
demand, and temporal demand

00:07:14.214 --> 00:07:16.183
VeasyGuide reduced significantly,

00:07:16.628 --> 00:07:17.862
The difficulty there.

00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:23.160
And more than that, qualitative
findings support our results.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.542
So VeasyGuide makes it easier
to follow along the instructor.

00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:28.800
L2 mentioned,

00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:31.464
"I felt as if the
instructor had control, so

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:33.856
I can connect with
the instructor's intent."

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.080
And L3 mentioned,
"It helped me stay with the instructor.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.040
I saw that the instructor was drawing
a boat and I was happy I did not miss it."

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.067
VeasyGuide also improved the
overall experience of learning.

00:07:46.433 --> 00:07:47.560
L1 mentioned,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.163
"One of the biggest
problems is that I don't know

00:07:50.188 --> 00:07:52.415
"what in the video requires my attention.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.760
VeasyGuide offloads this difficulty
to software, and I strain less."

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.115
L5 mentioned,

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.000
"I felt relaxed listening
instead of constantly

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.687
"worrying about where the
next thing would show up.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.782
I could just sit back, listen and learn,
and remember why I enjoy learning."

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.555
But of course, VeasyGuide contains
some limitations as well.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.240
First of all, the learning curve.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.040
So VeasyGuide has
some learning curve to it.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.960
L1 mentioned,
"I would have to get used to it.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.920
"But getting used to it and figuring out
my own workflow would let me,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.880
I think, worry less about the visual part
and focus more on the content."

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.720
And, some users wanted
more granular control.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.920
So beyond the personalization,
some users wanted more control.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.000
So L6 mentioned, "With the zoom,
parts of the screen get cut off.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.840
"So I might have missed things.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.880
"I'm not sure if there was a way
to move the zoom window,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.560
but I'd really like the freedom
to move it around."

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.120
So beyond what we did with personalization,

00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:53.941
some participants wanted
extra controls as well.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:59.278
For sighted participants, we found that
VeasyGuide provides some benefits as well.

00:09:00.085 --> 00:09:03.000
For example, it helps
retain and preserve attention.

00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:05.359
So S1 mentioned,

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.200
"If I'm bored, the highlights help

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.440
draw my attention back to the video
and to the right place."

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.520
It also helps focusing on the learning.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.200
With S2 mentioning, "I could
just focus on receiving information.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.371
It allowed me to focus
on the learning part."

00:09:20.396 --> 00:09:26.000
So, beyond low vision people, VeasyGuide
also has the potential to enhance

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.203
the learning experience for others as well.

00:09:29.453 --> 00:09:30.336
To conclude,

00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:33.900
we discuss in the paper on
how can we design tools to support

00:09:33.925 --> 00:09:37.000
low vision users in tasks
that require visual search.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.960
So we reflect on our findings
from the co-design process

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.560
as well as the user study.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.720
And we found four key
concepts as a design framework.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.847
The first one is familiarity
with target visuals.

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:53.000
The second is predictability
via spatial-temporal context.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.040
And personalization for changing needs.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.520
So all of these are extended
beyond the co-design findings.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.672
And we introduce another one,

00:10:01.697 --> 00:10:04.265
which is preserving user agency,

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:06.765
which I want to explain
in a little bit more detail.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.320
So VeasyGuide basically gives
low vision learners the choice

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.400
to look, see, or follow the instructor.

00:10:13.756 --> 00:10:18.600
And with VeasyGuide they have the freedom
to always find the right place of focus.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.120
So they can look anywhere else
in the slide and decide, actually,

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.360
I want to see what the
instructor is talking about now.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.320
So it gave them the option, similar
to sighted people, to basically see

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.437
whatever they want to see at the
time and not miss out on things.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.120
Thank you so much for listening.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.065
I'm very excited to share this work.

00:10:38.089 --> 00:10:39.656

VeasyGuide is available online right now

00:10:41.836 --> 00:10:44.218
with a few sample videos, but very soon

00:10:44.243 --> 00:10:47.984
you will be able to use your own videos
and have VeasyGuide work on them.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.040
So please stay tuned for that.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.273
And thank you so much.
